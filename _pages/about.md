I am interested in theoretical guarantees for machine learning methods that work reliably in real-life. 

Currently, I am studying Mathematics & Engineering in a dual masters program between [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) (*Cycle Ingénieur Civil*) and [Sorbonne Université](https://m2a.lip6.fr/) (*M2A*) in Paris, France. 

In the past, I've worked on PAC-Bayes bounds for ILE structured prediction at [Inria](https://inria.fr) & [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) and state estimation for underwater robotics at Schlumberger-Doll Research.

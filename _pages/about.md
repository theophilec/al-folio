I am interested in theoretical guarantees for machine learning methods: proving they are reliable and efficient... sometimes that they are optimal! 

Currently, I am working between Inria Paris and London under the direction of [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/), [Benjamin Guedj](https://bguedj.github.io/), and [Carlo Ciliberto](https://cciliber.github.io/).

I studied Mathematics & Engineering in a dual masters program between [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) (*Cycle Ingénieur Civil*) and [Sorbonne Université](https://m2a.lip6.fr/) (*M2A*) in Paris, France. 

In the past, I've worked on PAC-Bayes guarantess for structured prediction at [Inria](https://inria.fr) & [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), and state estimation for underwater robotics at Schlumberger-Doll Research.
